As a Sky Employee

I want to know when payday is

So that I know when I can buy all the things that I want to buy.

A/C:
- It must return the next payday.
- It should return the 27th of the month.
- If the 27th is a Saturday or Sunday it should return the previous day before the 27th which is not a Saturday or Sunday.
- In December, payday is on the 14th. Following all the same rules as above.
- If today is payday, the result should indicate that the returned date is today.
